# JAPAN BLOG

This blog have been made to share things i'll do, eat, and see while in Japan.
This is a simple blog, where you can see articles, a gallery of pics we took, the Google Map we made to travel.

## Purpose

I just wanted to share my experience in Japan. But this is also a way to train web Languages, web design. This will force me to shoot photos and to write content both on the website and on twitter.

## Help

If you want to help me in the development of this website, or just report a bug, send me a message on twitter, or e-mail me.
